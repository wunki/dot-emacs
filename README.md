# Petar does Emacs

This is my third Emacs configuration, and I can't promise that it will be the last.

In my previous attempt I collected too much junk over the years and this is a clean slate. A fresh Emacs, a minimal Emacs with babies breath.

I used to use Emacs for everything, from writing emails, to keeping my notes but these days I use it as an optimized environment for writing software. The philosophy of the configuration is:

* Minimal, as little distraction as possible.
* Beautiful, I care about aesthetics.

If you want to use this configuration, all you have to do is clone the repository and symlink it:

    ln -fns <repository> ~/.config/emacs
    
When you start it up, it will bootstrap itself. It may take a while the first time, so be patient.

Here's a screenshot of what you'll get:

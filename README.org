* .emacs

Hi! Are you ready to embrace the power of Emacs? This is my Emacs configuration which makes
heavy use of =use-package=. It's also highly opinionated and you may find enjoy yourself using
it if you appreciate the same things as me:

- Minimal, have as little distraction as possible.
- Beautiful, I care about aesthetics.

** Setup

If you want to use this configuration, all you have to do is clone the repository and symlink it:

#+begin_src shell
  ln -fns <repository> ~/.config/emacs
#+end_src
    
When you start Emacs it will bootstrap itself, have some patience, it will be rewarded.

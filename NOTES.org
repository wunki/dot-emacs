* Emacs

** <2024-01-16 Tue>

Lots of Emacs changes and happy the way Emacs looks right now. Only thing that still needs work is the modeline.

Let the journaling begin. At some point, I should write a post on how powerful Emacs is combined with LLMs. Knowing how to do it was the only difficulty in a completely malleable environment. Now, we can use LLMs to help.

** Tasks
*** TODO Change LSP in Markdown and Org-mode from eglot to LSP because eglot does not work with code actions.
*** TODO Clean up the modeline, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVbfzvTfsoY][see this video]].
